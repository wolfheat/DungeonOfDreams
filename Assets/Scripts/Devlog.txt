SUNO MUSIC
[Start]
[Intro]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
(record scratching) Like a DJ, Guitar solo, Drum Solo


You got a Dream

[Start]
	
[Verse]
You got a dream, you've got a vision
Don't you agree? Complete this mission
Deep down inside, the answer has grown
Dig deep and find, what you already know

[Chorus]
My game is great, game is fantastic,
I'm not the same, maybe I'm drastic
World passes by, and I got no clue
The game must complete, you have no clue
My game is great, game is fantastic,
I'm not the same, maybe I'm drastic
World passes by, and I got no clue
The game must complete, its all up to you

[Verse]
Early morning to the late of night
You keep on pushing through,
You see a glow throughout your fight
That shine comes from within you

[Chorus]
My game is great,(great) game is fantastic,
I'm not the same,(same) maybe I'm drastic
World passes by,(by by) I got no clue
The game must complete, it is up to you
My game is great,(great) game is fantastic,
I'm not the same,(same) maybe I'm drastic
World passes by,(by by) I got no clue
The game must complete, it is up to you



		-------------------
		* Julian feedback
		* BUG - Moving slider on Spinner or any Crafting station does not update the amount created text
		* BUG - Agency blob info is text is bugged but should also tell player how agency is gained somehow
		* BUG - Harvesting a stone, saving and reloading game, keeps stone as allready harvested but without red indicator
		* CHANGE - player get already harvested notification for mining the kiln
		* CHANGE - player is able to move after initiating a tool and before the mini game starts	
		* CHANGE - Spinner seems to queue up objects created, but player cant see this queue
		* SUGGESTION - Spinner should prob have a header showing the name of the station
		* SUGGESTION - the research station should state that the items needed to research wont get comsumed
		* SUGGESTION - would be nice to be able to TAB out of crafting stations

		// These bugs seems to happen after the game already broke some
		* BUG - Game not allowing tools to be dropped? Maybe this should be allowed. If inventory is full player cant pick up anything.
		* BUG - Placing the kiln leaves the icon in the inventory as well as placing it in world, it also gets placed before releasing mouse button, prob as soon as it hits a valid spot?
		* BUG - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo
		* BUG - equipping a tool when already having a tool equipped but no free space in inventory destroyes/"player lose" the removed tool
		* BUG - After a few seconds in the workstation the output changes to show the players inventory instead		
		* BUG - Time seems to have stopped at 12:40 on day 7	
			
		* Completing ballpeople task before activating the ballperson wont make it possible to complete the task?
		* small spelling error in the notice after exiting the fissure he -> the
		* player is able to jump when gathering sticks etc
		* No Translation found for seed - picture

		* BUG - Still an issue - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo Still an issue
			OUTPUT shown below crafting station at this point, saving at this point ruins/removes the save file from showing up in load (the aliv files exists in file system)
		* Going back to main menu unsets the sound settings briefly like half a second or so.
		* Going back to main menu and restarting a new game starts with old name filled in in the input box

		// Picking up stone right before using it for reconstruction messes up the popup amount -Video https://gemoo.com/tools/upload-video/share/625434510884421632?codeId=PYabol9J9lb4B&card=625434507273125888
		* SUGGESTION -  maybe have agency as an item in the compendium that describes more what it is and how to aquire it 


		* having bowl equipped and unequipping it still shows player holding it
		* Unable to save game - video
		* Setting audio for animals to 0 still allowes high volume for birds

		* Interacting with stations does not respond to E if its held or slowly pressed, only reacts to fast type E

		* NOT SURE - using wrong tool on harvested resource shows already harvested, should it be wrong tool notice?


		* SUGGESTION - Could have a light slider in settings, it gets a bit to dark in the night
		* Holding shift and starting to move should start as running, If it supposed to be a toggle for run then it should only switch off if player presses shift again
		* Settings store the sliders in volume at correct position but does not start audiosources at correct volume
		* Stuck in spyglass forever
		-------------------
		




		* SUGGESTION - Speed up boost -> destroys walls in one hit for 10 seconds

		* Implement load save or restart

		* Game to fast? - MAYBE
		* Have player auto change tool for what needs to be used
		* Make pickaxe tool instead of sledge hammer
