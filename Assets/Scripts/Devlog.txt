		* Enemy Controller has mesh renderer and MeshFilter, dont need it
		* enemy, needs other attack animation
		* Sometimes player can move onto same tile as enemy - fix
		* Sometimes spawned items are not updated as in front of player - FIxed?
		* Start working on a menu system
		* Health bar / hearts

		* Figure out game play hook

		* Make enemy occupy level grid correctly, as well as walls and player so grid can be used to step around - CHECK if correct
		* Make different meshes for different minerals

		// Enemies
		* Make Other death-animation for when enemy is killed by player
		* Adjust Enemy explosion effect to other particles?
		
		// Player
		* Have jingle play when player has a powerup?
		* Add sound effects for boosts running out?
		* Power-ups as rewards? Have player speed up for a limited time when finding secrets? Or just when finding powerups?
		* Have player tool light up with particle effects when speed boost is active

		// Walls
		* Make blocks have variarity in hitpoints / tools needed?
		* Add roots sticking out from roof
		* Have cracks show percentage of damage so they dont update every hit if the damage is to low etc

		// Scenes
		* Have end transition for completing game or dying that feels epic?

		// System
		* Extend sound data to include a list of sound clips
		* Extend sound data to include a list pitches?
		* Allow scalable game window

		* Game needs enemies and combat, have them roam in pockets that player mines into
			- Bomb enemy
			- Hit enemy
        
		// Bugs
		* Maybe issue with wrong block being hit, might be because the stack of walls in front of player is not updated when reaching new spot?

		

		-------------------
		* Julian feedback
		* BUG - Moving slider on Spinner or any Crafting station does not update the amount created text
		* BUG - Agency blob info is text is bugged but should also tell player how agency is gained somehow
		* BUG - Harvesting a stone, saving and reloading game, keeps stone as allready harvested but without red indicator
		* CHANGE - player get already harvested notification for mining the kiln
		* CHANGE - player is able to move after initiating a tool and before the mini game starts	
		* CHANGE - Spinner seems to queue up objects created, but player cant see this queue
		* SUGGESTION - Spinner should prob have a header showing the name of the station
		* SUGGESTION - the research station should state that the items needed to research wont get comsumed
		* SUGGESTION - would be nice to be able to TAB out of crafting stations

		// These bugs seems to happen after the game already broke some
		* BUG - Game not allowing tools to be dropped? Maybe this should be allowed. If inventory is full player cant pick up anything.
		* BUG - Placing the kiln leaves the icon in the inventory as well as placing it in world, it also gets placed before releasing mouse button, prob as soon as it hits a valid spot?
		* BUG - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo
		* BUG - equipping a tool when already having a tool equipped but no free space in inventory destroyes/"player lose" the removed tool
		* BUG - After a few seconds in the workstation the output changes to show the players inventory instead		
		* BUG - Time seems to have stopped at 12:40 on day 7	
			
		* Completing ballpeople task before activating the ballperson wont make it possible to complete the task?
		* small spelling error in the notice after exiting the fissure he -> the
		* player is able to jump when gathering sticks etc
		* No Translation found for seed - picture

		* BUG - Still an issue - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo Still an issue
			OUTPUT shown below crafting station at this point, saving at this point ruins/removes the save file from showing up in load (the aliv files exists in file system)
		* Going back to main menu unsets the sound settings briefly like half a second or so.
		* Going back to main menu and restarting a new game starts with old name filled in in the input box

		// Picking up stone right before using it for reconstruction messes up the popup amount -Video https://gemoo.com/tools/upload-video/share/625434510884421632?codeId=PYabol9J9lb4B&card=625434507273125888
		* SUGGESTION -  maybe have agency as an item in the compendium that describes more what it is and how to aquire it 


		* having bowl equipped and unequipping it still shows player holding it
		* Unable to save game - video
		* Setting audio for animals to 0 still allowes high volume for birds

		* Interacting with stations does not respond to E if its held or slowly pressed, only reacts to fast type E

		* NOT SURE - using wrong tool on harvested resource shows already harvested, should it be wrong tool notice?


		* SUGGESTION - Could have a light slider in settings, it gets a bit to dark in the night
		* Holding shift and starting to move should start as running, If it supposed to be a toggle for run then it should only switch off if player presses shift again
		* Settings store the sliders in volume at correct position but does not start audiosources at correct volume
		* Stuck in spyglass forever
		-------------------
		




		* SUGGESTION - Speed up boost -> destroys walls in one hit for 10 seconds

		* Implement level saving to file
		* Implement load save or restart

		* Game to fast? - MAYBE
		* Have player auto change tool for what needs to be used
		* Make pickaxe tool instead of sledge hammer
		* Have upgradable tools - MAYBE

		* If something is placed in game that looks like a promise, make sure it has a reward and is not just a mockup

		* // Make sures //

							- Secrets have player know how many secrets they found

			Appeal -> Presentation - Fantasy - Readability
			Scope -> 

		* Add animation for picking up items into inventory
		* Add animation for destroying walls
