		* Player picks up item when stepping on it -
		* Player can hit walls and destroy them
		* Added footsteps sound
		* Attack Animation keeps going when mouse is held -
25/2	* Destroyed walls now spawn items that drop into place
		* Moving away from wall makes miss sound but only if fully moved when hit happens, collider is allmost entire square 
		* Made Movement better, turning is now prioritized and after destroying wall player walks if motion is pressed.
26/2	* Fixed movement finally, can sidestep and hold buttons
		* Added alternative movement and action buttons
			* WASD-QE-Click = Main
			* IJKL-UO-Space = ALT 1
			* ArrowKeys-CTRL-NumKey0 (Delete-PgDn) SPACE = ALT 2 lefthanders
		* Added pause to game -
		* Tried to fix stuttering by fixing lerp end points
		* Added cracks to walls (walls have additional materials supplied from crackmaster class)
27/2	* Modified cracks
		* Minerals are pooled
28/2	* Made held mouse start action when reaching tile
		* Made block shock shen hit -
		* Made resource data as scriptable objects
		* Changed so only mineral typ is displayed as name when picking up
29/2	* Moved Wall LayerMask
		* Adjusted shake -
		* Fixed player position adjustment repositioning when moving
		* PowerUps can now be picked up like minerals
		* Added ability to set sound and particle effect in PowerUps data

		
		- Add the enemies

		* Add 2D visuals for pickup menu and later player menu

		* Extend sound data to include a list of sound clips
		* Extend sound data to include a list pitches?


		* Game needs enemies and combat, have them roam in pockets that player mines into
			- Bomb enemy
			- Hit enemy
        
		* Maybe issue with wrong block being hit, might be because the stack of walls in front of player is not updated when reaching new spot?

		* Make Wall data that defines walls health points and containing minerals
		* Have cracks show percentage of damage so they dont update every hit if the damage is to low etc

		* Power-ups as rewards? Have player speed up for a limited time when finding secrets? Or just when finding powerups?
		
		* SUGGESTION - Speed up boost -> destroys walls in one hit for 10 seconds

		* Implement level saving to file
		* Implement load save or restart

		* Game to fast? - MAYBE
		* Have player auto change tool for what needs to be used
		* Make pickaxe tool instead of sledge hammer
		* Have upgradable tools - MAYBE

		* If something is placed in game that looks like a promise, make sure it has a reward and is not just a mockup

		* // Make sures //

			Appeal -> Presentation - Fantasy - Readability

		* Add animation for picking up items into inventory
